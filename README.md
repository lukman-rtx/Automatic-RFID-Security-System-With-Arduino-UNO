# Automatic-RFID-Security-System-With-Arduino-UNO
Arduino UNO as a microcontroller can be developed for various types of implementation, for example it is used as a small to medium scale security system by utilizing various supporting modules. The working principle of this tool is quite simple, this system will scan the surrounding RFID cards/tags.
If the system recognizes the RFID card/tag, the system will display the “Open” status, and move the action module to the open position, the action module on the prototype designed to be drawn uses a servo motor to prop it up from the cabinet to open.
If the RFID card/tag is scanned again, the system will display the “Closed” status, and move the action module to the closed position. If the system does not recognize the RFID card/tag, the alarm will fire and the system will change to a locked state.
